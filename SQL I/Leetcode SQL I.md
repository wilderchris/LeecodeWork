595. Big Countries
Table: World

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | int     |
+-------------+---------+
name is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
 

A country is big if:

it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
Write an SQL query to report the name, population, and area of the big countries.

Return the result table in any order.
\\
Answer
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name, population, area FROM World WHERE (area >=3000000) OR (population >= 25000000)

1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.
\\
Answer
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'

Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
 

Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

\\
Answer
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT employee_id, if(employee_id % 2 = 0 OR  name LIKE 'M%',0,salary) as bonus FROM Employees ORDER BY employee_id ASC

627. Swap Salary

Table: Salary

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |

+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.

Answer
# Write your MySQL query statement below
UPDATE Salary 
SET sex = if(sex='m', 'f', 'm')

196. Delete Duplicate Emails

+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.
